# sql-challenge

## Overview

This challenge is divided into three parts: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis. The goal is to construct a database that captures the details of employees and their departmental affiliations, utilizing SQL for data manipulation and queries.

## Data Modeling

* Task: Inspect the provided CSV files and sketch an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that outlines the structure of the database tables.
* Tools Used: QuickDBD or any similar ERD tool.

## Data Engineering

* Schema Definition: Define a table schema for each CSV file including data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
* Primary Keys: Ensure each table has a unique primary key, or use a composite key if necessary.
* Foreign Keys: Establish relationships between tables using foreign keys.
* CSV Import: Load each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table, ensuring data integrity and correct relationships.

## Data Analysis
### Queries: Perform SQL queries to retrieve specific information:

* Employee details including salary.
* Employees hired in 1986.
* Department managers and their details.
* Department details for each employee.
* Employees named Hercules with a last name starting with 'B'.
* Employees in the Sales and/or Development departments.
* Frequency counts of employee last names.
